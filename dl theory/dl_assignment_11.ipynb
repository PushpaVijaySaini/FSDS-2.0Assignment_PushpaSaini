        "Ans: Matrix multiplication involves a large number of arithmetic operations, and performing those operations using the basic Python operations can be slow because Python is an interpreted language, which means that it has to interpret and execute each line of code at runtime. This can lead to a significant overhead when working with large matrices.\n",
