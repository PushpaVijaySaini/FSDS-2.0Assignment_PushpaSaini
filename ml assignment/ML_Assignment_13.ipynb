        "\n",
        " Prior could be the probability distribution representing the relative proportions of voters who will vote for a particular politician in a future election. The unknown quantity may be a parameter of the model or a latent variable rather than an observable variable.\n",
        "Posterior probability is a revised probability that takes into account new available information. For example, let there be two urns, urn A having 5 black balls and 10 red balls and urn B having 10 black balls and 5 red balls. Now if an urn is selected at random, the probability that urn A is chosen is 0.5.\n",
        "Likelihood the probability of getting heads when flipping a fair coin is 0.5 because there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails), and each outcome has an equal likelihood of occurring.\n",

        "2. What role does Bayes' theorem play in the concept learning principle ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayes theorem plays an important role in the concept learning principle. It is used to calculate the probability of a concept given evidence. Specifically, it helps to calculate the probability of a concept belonging to a certain class given the evidence that it has certain properties. The probability is then used to help determine which concept is most likely to be the correct one. This helps to improve the accuracy of concept learning by helping to reduce the chances of incorrect decisions being made.\n",

        "3. Offer an example of how the Nave Bayes classifier is used in real life ?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Naïve Bayes classifier is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks such as text classification. It belongs to the family of generative learning algorithms, which means that it models the distribution of inputs for a given class or category.\n",
        "The Naive Bayes classifier is used in real life in many applications, such as email spam filtering, document classification, and medical diagnosis. For example, a Naive Bayes classifier could be used to classify emails as spam or legitimate. The classifier would use the presence of certain words or phrases in the email to determine whether it is spam or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can the Nave Bayes classifier be used on continuous numeric data? If so, how can you go about doing it?\n",
        "\n",
        "the Naive Bayes classifier can be used on continuous numeric data. To do this, you have to bin the data into discrete intervals or categories. This can be done by defining a function that takes the numeric data and assigns it to different bins. Once the data is binned, the Naive Bayes classifier can be used as usual.\n",

        "5. What are Bayesian Belief Networks, and how do they work? What are their applications? Are they capable of resolving a wide range of issues?\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are probabilistic graphical models that are used to represent uncertain knowledge and make decisions based on that knowledge. They are a type of Bayesian network, which is a graphical model that represents probabilistic relationships between variables.\n",

BBNs can be used to solve problems in many different fields, including finance, economics, engineering, and medicine. However, it is important to remember that they are not a silver bullet, and they require careful analysis and interpretation to be effective.\n",

There may be a customer coming into the bank with a 5% chance in each 5-minute time period, or there may be no customer (again, for simplicity, we assume that either there is 1 customer or none, not the case of multiple customers).
