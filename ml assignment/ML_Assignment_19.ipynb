        "ANS. For most common hierarchical clustering software, the default distance measure is the Euclidean distance. This is the square root of the sum of the square differences. However, for gene expression, correlation distance is often used. The metric is used to decide when to end the iteration in hierarchical clustering by setting a threshold value. Once the distance between the centroids of the clusters is less than or equal to the threshold value, the iteration is stopped and the clusters are considered to be complete\n",
